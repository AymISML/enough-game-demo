          "Text": "Keep breastfeeding every time Maryam seems hungry.",
          "Note": "Exclusive breastfeeding is ideal. Breast milk provides all necessary nutrition for Maryam’s first six months of life because it provides the perfect balance of nutrients, antibodies, and enzymes are essential for a baby’s healthy development. Unclean water and liquids other than breastmilk can increase the risk of infections."

Her body isn't prepared for other foods yet. Introducing other foods before 6 months, such as watery porridge, doesn't provide enough essential nutrients that are crucial for a baby's growth and development."
